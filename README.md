Thesis/research project. Long Short Term Memory (deep learning model) for prediction of dissolved oxygen in coastal waters.

This project was completed by me in May 2022 as an Applied Research Project in part fulfilment of a MSc in Data Analytics.

Coastal water data from the Marine Institute was used and contains information on physico-chemical properties of seawater,
obtained by monitoring buoys off the coast of Co. Galway, Ireland.

A Long Short Term Memory model was used for the prediction of dissolved oxygen levels. This deep learning model was suitable as it
is effective for time series analysis. It is capable of learning patterns in non-stationary data.

Similar projects in the literature provide short-term predictions, however,
here, the prediction window was greatly improved by extending it to 32 hours.

A full write-up is included in the file "Thesis".
